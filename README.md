## Queen Bee

The Queen Bee is a mini-boss with 100 HP that starts off friendly to the player. But if you attack her, other bees around her will become angry and attack you. During the fight, she'll inflict poison and nausea on you, and if you stay too close, she might spawn a poison nimbus. But if you defeat her, you'll be rewarded with her antennas.

## Items

The mod introduces three new items: the Stinger, Stinger Sword, and Antenna. Each item has its own special uses that can give you an advantage in your Minecraft adventures.

### Antenna

The Antenna is dropped by the Queen Bee and has a special ability - equipping it will cause bees to never aggro on you. But it gets even better - using it with the Stinger Sword will unlock a new ability. With a simple shift+right click, you can summon a friendly bee that will give you and nearby friends the regeneration effect.

### Stinger

Stingers are dropped by bees and can be used in a variety of ways. You can eat a stinger to inflict poison and nausea on yourself (Idk, why you would do that lol), or use it to create a poison potion. But the most exciting use for stingers is to create the Stinger Sword.

### Stinger Sword

Crafted with stingers dropped by bees, the Stinger Sword is faster than other swords in the game and inflicts poison and nausea on your enemies. But its real power comes when it's paired with the Antenna. With shift+right click, you can summon a friendly bee that will give you and nearby friends the regeneration effect.
